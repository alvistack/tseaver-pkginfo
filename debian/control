Description: Query metadatdata from sdists / bdists / installed packages
 This package provides an API for querying the distutils metadata written
 in the PKG-INFO file inside a source distriubtion (an sdist) or a binary
 distribution (e.g., created by running bdist\_egg). It can also query
 the EGG-INFO directory of an installed distribution, and the \*.egg-info
 stored in a “development checkout” (e.g, created by running setup.py
 develop).
